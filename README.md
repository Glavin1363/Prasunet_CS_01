Create a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.

Caesar Cipher
This project implements a simple Caesar Cipher algorithm in Python. The Caesar Cipher is a basic encryption technique where each letter in a text is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

Features
Encryption: Shifts each letter in the input text by a specified number of positions.
Decryption: Reverses the shift to retrieve the original text.
Usage
Run the Program: Execute the Python script and follow the prompts.
User Input:
Choose to encrypt or decrypt.
Enter the message.
Enter the shift value.
